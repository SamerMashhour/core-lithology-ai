# CoreLithoClassifier

A demonstration project integrating geology, machine learning, and image processing to classify core samples based on synthetic geochemical data and core imagery.

##  Project Objective

This project simulates how core imagery and associated geochemical data can be used together to build lithology classifiers. It mimics a simplified version of what core scanning AI systems aim to achieve.

##  Features

- Synthetic core imagery generator for Mafic, Ultramafic, and Felsic lithologies
- Geochemical data simulation (Ni, Cu, Fe, S)
- Image preprocessing using OpenCV and PIL
- Feature extraction (color histograms, edge detection, GLCM texture)
- Geochemistry-based PCA and clustering
- CNN model to classify lithology directly from images

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV, Pillow
- TensorFlow/Keras (for CNNs)
